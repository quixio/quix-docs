# Introduction

The Streaming Writer API allows you to stream data into the Quix
platform via HTTP endpoints or SignalR. It’s an alternative to using our
C\# and Python client libraries. You can use the Streaming Writer API from any
HTTP-capable language.

The API is fully documented in our [Swagger
documentation](get-swagger.md). Read on for a
guide to using the API, including real-world examples you can execute
from your language of choice, or via the command line using curl.

## Preparation

If you plan on using the HTTP endpoints, then you’ll need to know how to
[authenticate your requests](authenticate.md)
and how to [form a typical request to the API](request.md).

If you would rather use the SignalR api, which is suggested for high
frequency data streaming, then see [SignalR setup](../streaming-reader-api/signalr.md).
