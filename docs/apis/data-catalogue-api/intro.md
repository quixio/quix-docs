# Introduction

The Data Catalogue HTTP API allows you to fetch data stored in the Quix
platform. You can use it for exploring the platform, prototyping
applications, or working with stored data in any language with HTTP
capabilities.

The API is fully described in our [Swagger
documentation](get-swagger.md). Read on for
a guide to using the API, including real-world examples you can execute
from your language of choice, or via the command line using `curl`.

## Preparation

Before using any of the endpoints, you’ll need to know how to
[authenticate your requests](authenticate.md) and
how to [form a typical request to the
API](request.md).

You’ll also need to have some data stored in the Quix platform for API
use to be meaningful. You can use any Source of our [Quix Library](../../platform/samples/samples.md) to do this using the Quix
portal.
