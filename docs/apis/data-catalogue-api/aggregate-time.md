# Aggregate data by time

You can downsample and upsample data from the catalogue using the
`/parameters/data` endpoint.

## Before you begin

  - If you donâ€™t already have any Stream data in your workspace, you can use any Source of our [Quix Library](../../platform/samples/samples.md) to set some up.

  - [Get a Personal Access Token](authenticate.md)

## Aggregating and interpolating

The JSON payload can include a `groupByTime` property, an object with
the following members:

  - `timeBucketDuration`  
    The duration, in nanoseconds, for one aggregated value.

  - `interpolationType`  
    Specify how additional values should be generated when
    interpolating.

For example, imagine you have a set of speed data, with values recorded
at 1-second intervals. You can group such data into 2-second intervals,
aggregated by mean average, with the following:

``` json
{
    "groupByTime": {
        "timeBucketDuration": 2000000000,
    },
    "numericParameters": [{
        "parameterName": "Speed",
        "aggregationType": "Mean"
    }]
}
```

You can specify an `interpolationType` to define how any missing values
are generated. `Linear` will provide a value in linear proportion,
whilst `Previous` will repeat the value before the one that was missing.

``` json
{
    "from": 1612191286000000000,
    "to":   1612191295000000000,
    "numericParameters": [{
        "parameterName": "Speed",
        "aggregationType": "First"
    }],
    "groupByTime": {
        "timeBucketDuration": 2000000000,
        "interpolationType": "None"
    },
    "streamIds": [ "302b1de3-2338-43cb-8148-3f0d6e8c0b8a" ]
}
```
