# Introduction

As an alternative to [the SDK](../../sdk/read.html), the Quix platform
supports real-time data streaming over WebSockets. Clients can receive
updates on data and definitions for parameters and events, as they
happen. The examples shown use the Microsoft
[SignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/javascript-client?view=aspnetcore-5.0){target=_blank}
JavaScript client library.
