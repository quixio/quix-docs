# Connectors

Connectors are part of our [open source](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples){target="_blank"} repository of samples, examples and integrations.

Connectors help our users connect with other vendors such as AWS and Kafka.

You can explore the connector README files here in Quix Docs. When you are ready to start using them, head over to the Quix Code Samples [GitHub](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples){target="_blank"} repository, or A Quix Cloud account. [Book a demo with us](https://meetings.hubspot.com/mike-rosam/product-demo){target="_blank"}.
