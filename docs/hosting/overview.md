# Quix Hosting Options

Quix offers multiple ways to deploy the platform, from **fully managed** solutions to **self-hosted BYOC** options. Our managed services range from a **serverless, multi-tenant model** to **single-tenant deployments** hosted in your own cloud account.

For self-hosted solutions, our team can help tailor the best fit for your needs. [Contact sales](https://quix.io/book-a-demo) to explore your options.

## Fully managed

With our **fully managed** deployment, you get the ultimate hands-off experience. We take care of everything—**infrastructure, monitoring, scaling, and maintenance**—so you can focus on building and running your applications. Our team ensures high availability, security, and performance, proactively managing your environment so you don’t have to. We provide a reliable, seamless, worry-free solution. See our full range [here](https://quix.io/pricing).

## Bring your own cluster (BYOC)

BYOC allows customers to host Quix on their own cloud infrastructure, providing greater **security, control, and ownership** over their deployment. Quix offers two approaches: **Blackbox Deployment**, where we handle the entire setup with admin permissions while you maintain ownership of infrastructure, and **Guided Self Hosted Deployment**, where your team maintains full control while following our expert guidance and automation tools. For installation details, refer to our [Notion guides](https://quix.notion.site/Welcome-to-Quix-17c84393c0f280788357fb8dca6ce116).

## Hybrid

Hybrid deployments provide the best of both worlds: a managed control plane by Quix ensures high availability and hassle-free operations, while you maintain full control over your deployment clusters. Moreover, while other solutions support multi-cluster setups, the hybrid approach greatly benefits from enabling unified management across different regions, cloud providers, or even serving multiple customers on separate clusters to meet compliance requirements—all under a single control plane. For the control plane, the solution follows the Fully Managed or blackbox installation on Cloud approach, while for the deployment clusters, the custom guide applies, giving you the flexibility to tailor your infrastructure as needed.
