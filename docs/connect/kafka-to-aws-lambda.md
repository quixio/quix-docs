Quix helps you integrate Apache Kafka with Apache Airflow using pure Python.

Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house arthitectures, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a revolutionary serverless computing platform offered by Amazon Web Services. It allows developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers, making it incredibly flexible and cost-effective. With AWS Lambda, users can simply upload their code and specify the events that should trigger it, whether it's an API call, a file upload, or a database change. This technology automatically scales to handle the incoming traffic and only charges users for the compute time they consume. AWS Lambda streamlines the development process, allowing teams to focus on building innovative applications without the hassle of infrastructure management.
