## Next.js

Next.js is a popular open-source JavaScript framework that allows developers to build fast and efficient web applications. It is built on top of React, making it easy to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. One of the key features of Next.js is server-side rendering, which helps improve performance and SEO by generating HTML pages on the server and sending them to the client. Next.js also supports static site generation and incremental static regeneration, allowing developers to pre-render pages at build time and update them as needed. With features like automatic code splitting, hot module replacement, and built-in CSS support, Next.js provides a seamless development experience for building modern web applications.
