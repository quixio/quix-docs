## AWS RDS

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Relational Database Service (RDS) is a cloud-based service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. With AWS RDS, users can choose from several popular database engines, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and MariaDB, and benefit from automated backups, monitoring, and patching. This fully managed service allows businesses to focus on their applications without the hassle of managing a traditional database infrastructure. AWS RDS provides high availability, security, and performance, making it a reliable choice for organizations looking to leverage the power of the cloud for their database needs.
