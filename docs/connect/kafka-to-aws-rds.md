Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house architecture, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## AWS RDS

AWS RDS, or Amazon Web Services Relational Database Service, is a fully managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. With AWS RDS, users can choose from several database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and MariaDB, to store their data. The service automatically handles routine database tasks such as provisioning, patching, backups, and monitoring, allowing users to focus on building their applications. AWS RDS also offers high availability, automatic failover, and read replicas to ensure that databases remain responsive and reliable. This technology is particularly valuable for businesses looking to offload the management of their databases and streamline their operations.
