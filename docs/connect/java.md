## Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1991 and released to the public in 1995. It is known for its versatility, as it can be used to develop a wide range of applications, from simple web applications to complex enterprise systems. Java is platform-independent, meaning it can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine installed. This feature has made Java one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Additionally, Java has a large standard library that provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools for building applications efficiently.
