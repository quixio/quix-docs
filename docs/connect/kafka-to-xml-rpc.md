## XML-RPC

XML-RPC, short for Extensible Markup Language Remote Procedure Call, is a protocol that facilitates communication between different systems over the internet. It allows for the exchange of structured data in a standardized format, utilizing XML to define the data being sent between the client and server. XML-RPC is a powerful tool for enabling interoperability between diverse systems and programming languages, making it a valuable resource for building distributed applications and web services. With XML-RPC, developers can easily create APIs that can be accessed remotely, simplifying the process of integrating different technologies and systems.
