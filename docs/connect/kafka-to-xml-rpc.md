## XML-RPC

XML-RPC, short for Extensible Markup Language Remote Procedure Call, is a protocol that allows software running different operating systems and in different environments to communicate with each other. It is based on XML, a widely-used markup language for encoding data in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. XML-RPC enables developers to invoke methods on remote servers using structured messaging, making it a powerful tool for building distributed systems and web services. Its simplicity and interoperability have made it a popular choice for integrating applications and services across networks.
