## AWS Managed Blockchain

AWS Managed Blockchain is a cloud-based service that allows users to create and manage blockchain networks. With this technology, users can easily set up and deploy secure and scalable blockchain networks without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. AWS takes care of the heavy lifting, such as provisioning nodes, managing certificates, and handling the encryption keys. This allows users to focus on developing their applications and smart contracts, while AWS ensures the network is secure and resilient. With AWS Managed Blockchain, users can take advantage of the benefits of blockchain technology, such as transparency, immutability, and decentralization, without the complexity of managing a blockchain network on their own.
