## AWS Athena

AWS Athena is a powerful interactive query service that allows users to analyze data stored in Amazon S3 using standard SQL queries. With Athena, there is no need to set up complex ETL processes or manage infrastructure, as it provides a simple and cost-effective solution for querying data on-demand. Users can easily run ad-hoc queries to gain valuable insights from their data, making it a valuable tool for data analysts and business intelligence professionals. Additionally, AWS Athena integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, providing a flexible and scalable solution for querying large datasets in the cloud.
