## AWS Resource Access Manager

AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) is a tool provided by Amazon Web Services that allows users to share AWS resources with other accounts within their organization or across organizational boundaries. This service simplifies resource sharing while maintaining control over who has access to the shared resources. By utilizing AWS RAM, organizations can centrally manage permissions for shared resources, ensuring secure and efficient collaboration between different teams and departments. With AWS RAM, users can easily create and manage resource shares, track resource usage, and monitor access permissions across multiple AWS accounts. This technology streamlines resource sharing processes and enhances overall resource management within the AWS ecosystem.
