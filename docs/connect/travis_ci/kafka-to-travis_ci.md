## Travis CI

Travis CI is a continuous integration service that is commonly used in software development to automate the testing and deployment of code changes. It works by connecting to a developer's repository on platforms such as GitHub or Bitbucket, and then running tests on the code whenever changes are made. Travis CI allows developers to create custom testing scripts and workflows, which can help catch bugs and issues early in the development process. It also provides integrations with various cloud platforms for deploying code changes automatically. Overall, Travis CI helps to streamline the development process and ensure that code changes are thoroughly tested before being deployed to production environments.
