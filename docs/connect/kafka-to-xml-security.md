## XML Security

XML Security is a set of protocols and technologies used to secure and protect XML documents and data. It provides authentication, integrity, confidentiality, and non-repudiation for data exchanged between different systems and applications. XML Security can be implemented using various standards such as XML Signature, XML Encryption, and XML Key Management. It is essential for ensuring the trustworthiness and confidentiality of sensitive information transmitted over the internet or stored in databases. With XML Security, organizations can establish secure communication channels and safeguard their data from unauthorized access or tampering.
