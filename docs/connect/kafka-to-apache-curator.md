## Apache Curator

Apache Curator is a robust Java library that simplifies the development of distributed systems by providing high-level abstractions and utilities for common tasks such as leader election, distributed locking, and service discovery. It offers a variety of recipes that address different challenges faced when building distributed applications on Apache ZooKeeper, ensuring that developers can focus on writing business logic rather than dealing with the intricacies of distributed coordination. With features like automatic connection management, error handling, and retry policies, Apache Curator empowers developers to build reliable and scalable distributed systems with ease.
