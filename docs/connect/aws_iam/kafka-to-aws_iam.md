## AWS IAM

AWS IAM, or Identity and Access Management, is a powerful tool offered by Amazon Web Services that allows users to securely control access to their AWS resources. With IAM, users can manage users, groups, and roles, and assign specific permissions to them based on their specific needs. IAM helps users adhere to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users only have access to the resources they need to perform their job functions. This granular level of control not only enhances security but also helps organizations maintain compliance with various regulatory requirements. Overall, AWS IAM is a critical component in ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data and resources within the AWS cloud environment.
