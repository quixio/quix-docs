Quix helps you integrate Apache Kafka with Apache Airflow using pure Python.

Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house arthitectures, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)

AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a highly reliable and scalable block storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to create and attach persistent block storage volumes to their EC2 instances, providing the necessary storage capacity for running applications and storing data. EBS volumes are designed for high availability and durability, with automatic backups and encryption options available. With EBS, users can easily increase or decrease storage capacity as needed, making it a flexible and efficient storage solution for a wide range of use cases.
