## Apache Knox

Apache Knox is a technology that provides a centralized access point for secure and controlled access to resources and services in a Hadoop cluster. It acts as a gateway for external clients to interact with the Hadoop ecosystem, providing authentication, authorization, and audit capabilities. Apache Knox ensures that only authorized users and applications are able to access the cluster resources, while also enabling administrators to monitor and manage access policies. By centralizing access control and security protocols, Apache Knox helps organizations ensure data protection and compliance with regulatory requirements in their Hadoop environments.
