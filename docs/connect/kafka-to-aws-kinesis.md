Quix helps you integrate Apache Kafka with AWS Kinesis using pure Python.

Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house architecture, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## AWS Kinesis

AWS Kinesis is a real-time data streaming service provided by Amazon Web Services, designed to enable developers to ingest massive amounts of data from various sources and process it in real time. This technology allows users to easily collect, process, and analyze data streams such as website clickstreams, application logs, social media feeds, and IoT telemetry data. With AWS Kinesis, developers can build real-time applications, generate analytics, and respond to events as they happen, providing valuable insights and actionable information in the fastest and most efficient way possible.
