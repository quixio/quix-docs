## AWS Database Migration Service

AWS Database Migration Service is a technology that allows users to easily and securely migrate their databases to AWS cloud. It supports both homogenous and heterogeneous migrations, meaning users can migrate their databases from one database engine to another. With AWS Database Migration Service, users can minimize downtime during the migration process, maintain data consistency, and replicate ongoing changes from the source database to the target database. This technology simplifies the migration process by handling all the complexities involved in database migration, such as schema conversion, data transfer, and maintaining data integrity. AWS Database Migration Service provides a seamless and efficient way for users to migrate their databases to AWS cloud without worrying about data loss or disruption to their applications.
