Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house architecture, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## Apache Parquet

Apache Parquet is an open-source columnar storage format that is widely used in the big data ecosystem. It is specifically designed for efficient and high-performance analytics against large datasets. Parquet utilizes a compressed and efficient file format to store data, allowing for fast query processing and reduced storage overhead. With its ability to support complex data structures, nested data types, and efficient encoding schemes, Parquet is a popular choice for data processing frameworks like Apache Spark and Apache Hive. Its compatibility with various programming languages and storage systems makes it a versatile and powerful tool for data analytics and processing.
