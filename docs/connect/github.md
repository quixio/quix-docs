## GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform that serves as a hub for developers to collaborate on projects by providing tools for version control and project management. Users can create repositories to store code, track changes made by themselves and others, and merge changes seamlessly. GitHub also offers features such as issue tracking, code review, and wikis to facilitate communication and collaboration among team members. In addition, GitHub allows for easy integration with other development tools and services, making it a valuable resource for software development teams to work together efficiently and effectively.
