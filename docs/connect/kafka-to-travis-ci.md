## Travis CI

Travis CI is a continuous integration tool used by software developers to automatically build and test their code in real-time. It allows for automated testing of code changes, ensuring that new features or updates do not break the existing code base. Travis CI integrates seamlessly with popular version control systems like GitHub, making it a valuable tool for teams working on collaborative projects. With Travis CI, developers can catch bugs early in the development process, leading to more stable and reliable software releases.
