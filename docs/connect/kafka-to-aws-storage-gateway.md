## AWS Storage Gateway

AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services, allowing customers to seamlessly integrate their on-premises storage infrastructure with the AWS cloud. This technology enables businesses to securely store data in the cloud while still maintaining low-latency access to frequently accessed data on-premises. By acting as a bridge between on-premises environments and the cloud, AWS Storage Gateway offers scalable and cost-effective storage solutions for businesses of all sizes. With capabilities such as file, volume, and tape storage, AWS Storage Gateway provides a flexible and scalable storage solution for a variety of use cases.
