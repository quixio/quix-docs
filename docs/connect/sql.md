## SQL

Structured Query Language, or SQL, is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL allows users to retrieve and store data, as well as perform various operations on that data such as adding, updating, and deleting records. It is widely used in both small-scale and large-scale database management systems, making it a crucial technology for businesses and organizations looking to efficiently store and access their data. SQL is versatile and powerful, offering a standardized way to work with databases across different platforms and systems. With its intuitive syntax and strong capabilities, SQL has become an essential tool for developers, data analysts, and database administrators.
