## AWS Security Hub

AWS Security Hub is a comprehensive security service by Amazon Web Services that provides a centralized place to manage security alerts and compliance status across an organization's AWS accounts. It continuously monitors and analyzes the security of AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and IAM roles, and consolidates findings from AWS GuardDuty, Inspector, and Macie, as well as third-party security tools. Security Hub offers automated security checks, prioritized security findings, and integrated workflows to help security teams quickly identify and remediate potential threats. With Security Hub, organizations can improve their security posture, streamline compliance audits, and gain better visibility into their overall security environment.
