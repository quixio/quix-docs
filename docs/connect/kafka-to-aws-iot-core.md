Quix helps you integrate Apache Kafka with AWS IoT Core using pure Python.

Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house arthitecture, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## AWS IoT Core

AWS IoT Core is a managed cloud service that allows connected devices to securely interact with cloud applications and other devices. It provides a platform for managing and communicating with internet-connected devices, enabling users to collect, process, and analyze data generated by these devices. With AWS IoT Core, developers can easily connect devices to the cloud, securely authenticate and authorize devices, and manage resources at scale. This technology plays a crucial role in powering the Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services, offering a reliable and scalable solution for building connected systems.

Quix is a well-suited platform for integrating with AWS IoT Core due to its ability to efficiently handle data from various sources, pre-process and transform it before loading it into specific data formats, and seamlessly sink transformed data to cloud storage. The platform's customizable connectors make it easy for data engineers to adapt to different destinations, simplifying lakehouse architecture. Additionally, Quix Streams, an open-source Python library, supports the transformation of data using streaming DataFrames, enabling operations like aggregation, filtering, and merging during the transformation process. With no throughput limits, automatic backpressure management, and checkpointing, Quix ensures that data is efficiently handled from source to destination. Moreover, the platform offers a cost-effective solution for managing data throughout the entire integration process, making it a valuable tool for organizations looking to lower their total cost of ownership in data handling.
