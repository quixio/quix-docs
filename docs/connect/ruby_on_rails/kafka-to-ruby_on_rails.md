## Ruby on Rails

Ruby on Rails is a popular web application framework written in the Ruby programming language. It is designed to make web development faster and easier by providing a set of tools and conventions for building robust and scalable applications. Ruby on Rails emphasizes convention over configuration, meaning that developers can quickly get started with building their applications without needing to spend time configuring settings. It also follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which helps to keep code organized and maintainable. Overall, Ruby on Rails is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and productivity, making it a favorite among developers for building modern web applications.
