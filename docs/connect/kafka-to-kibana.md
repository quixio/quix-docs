Quix helps you integrate Apache Kafka with Kibana using pure Python.

Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house arthitecture, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## Kibana

Kibana is an open-source data visualization dashboard tool designed to work with Elasticsearch. It provides users with the ability to explore, analyze, and visualize their data through dynamic dashboards and visualizations. With Kibana, users can easily create bar charts, line graphs, heat maps, and other visualizations to gain insights from their data. Its user-friendly interface makes it easy for both technical and non-technical users to interact with their data and uncover valuable insights.
