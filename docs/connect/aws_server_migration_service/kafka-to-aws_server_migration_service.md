## AWS Server Migration Service

The AWS Server Migration Service is a technology developed by Amazon Web Services that simplifies the process of migrating servers to the AWS cloud. This service automates the migration by taking snapshots of on-premises servers and transferring them to Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) in the cloud. It also allows for the continuous replication of live servers, reducing downtime during the migration process. This technology supports both Windows and Linux servers and provides a streamlined, efficient way for businesses to transition their workloads to the cloud. With AWS Server Migration Service, organizations can easily scale their infrastructure, improve resource utilization, and enhance overall business agility.
