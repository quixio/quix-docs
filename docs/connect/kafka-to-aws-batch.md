Quix helps you integrate Apache Kafka with AWS Batch using pure Python.

Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house arthitecture, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## AWS Batch

AWS Batch is a cloud computing service provided by Amazon Web Services that allows developers to run batch computing workloads on the cloud. With AWS Batch, users can easily scale and manage the execution of their batch processing jobs, without the need to provision, monitor, or manage their own compute resources. This service automatically provisions the right amount of compute resources based on the specific requirements of the job, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency. AWS Batch empowers developers to focus on their applications and data, while the service takes care of the underlying infrastructure and scaling needs.
