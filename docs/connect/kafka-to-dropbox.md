## Dropbox

Dropbox is a file hosting service that offers cloud storage, file synchronization, personal cloud, and client software. It allows users to create a special folder on their computers, which Dropbox then synchronizes so that it appears to be the same folder regardless of which device is used to view it. Users can access their synced files from any device with an internet connection, making it easy to collaborate with others and access important documents on the go. Dropbox has become a popular tool for individuals and businesses looking to streamline their file sharing and storage processes.
