## AWS Step Functions

AWS Step Functions is a cloud service provided by Amazon Web Services that enables developers to design and coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows. This technology allows for the creation of complex, scalable workflows that can automate business processes, orchestrate microservices, and manage state transitions within applications. With AWS Step Functions, developers can easily visualize and monitor the progress of their workflows, and ensure that each step is executed in the correct order. This powerful tool significantly simplifies the process of creating and managing distributed applications in the cloud.
