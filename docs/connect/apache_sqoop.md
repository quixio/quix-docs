## Apache Sqoop

Apache Sqoop is an open-source technology that facilitates the transfer of data between Apache Hadoop and relational databases. By providing a simple command-line interface, Sqoop allows users to import data from databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL into Hadoop for analysis and processing. Additionally, Sqoop enables users to export data from Hadoop back into these databases. This tool streamlines the data transfer process, making it easier for organizations to incorporate data from various sources into their big data ecosystem. With its efficiency and scalability, Apache Sqoop is a valuable tool for data engineers and analysts working with large volumes of data in the Hadoop ecosystem.
