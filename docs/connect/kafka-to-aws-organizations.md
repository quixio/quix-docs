## AWS Organizations

AWS Organizations is a cloud service provided by Amazon Web Services that enables users to centrally manage and govern multiple AWS accounts. This technology allows organizations to set policies and permissions across all their accounts, ensuring consistent security and compliance measures. By organizing accounts into hierarchical groups and applying policies at different levels, users can easily control access, manage budgets, and streamline resource deployment. AWS Organizations simplifies the management of complex cloud environments, making it easier for businesses to scale their operations and adhere to best practices.
