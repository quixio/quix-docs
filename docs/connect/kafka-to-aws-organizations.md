## AWS Organizations

AWS Organizations is a sophisticated cloud-based service provided by Amazon Web Services that allows businesses to centrally manage and govern their multiple AWS accounts. With AWS Organizations, organizations can set up groupings of accounts based on business units, departments, or projects, and define policies to manage permissions, access controls, and budgets across all these accounts. This technology enables businesses to efficiently scale their AWS infrastructure, optimize costs, and ensure compliance with security and regulatory standards. By simplifying and streamlining the management of multiple AWS accounts, AWS Organizations helps organizations achieve greater agility and flexibility in their cloud operations.
