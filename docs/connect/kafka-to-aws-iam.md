## AWS IAM

AWS IAM stands for Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management. It is a powerful tool that allows users to securely control access to AWS services and resources. With IAM, administrators can create and manage user accounts, assign permissions, and set up multi-factor authentication to enhance security. IAM helps organizations adhere to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users only have access to the resources they need to perform their job functions. Additionally, IAM enables users to easily track and audit user activity within their AWS environment, providing valuable insights into security threats and compliance issues. Overall, AWS IAM is a crucial component in ensuring the security and integrity of AWS infrastructure.
