## AWS IAM

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a powerful security service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to securely control access to resources in their AWS account. With AWS IAM, users can manage permissions for creating and managing AWS resources, as well as control who can access those resources. IAM enables organizations to set up unique security credentials for individual users or groups, providing granular control over who can access specific resources within their AWS environment. This robust security management tool is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of AWS resources.
