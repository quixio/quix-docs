## AWS Route 53

AWS Route 53 is a highly scalable and reliable domain name system (DNS) web service offered by Amazon Web Services. It effectively routes end users to internet applications by translating human-readable domain names into numeric IP addresses. The service also allows users to configure DNS health checks to monitor the health and performance of their applications. With global coverage, low-latency routing, and robust security features, AWS Route 53 ensures high availability and improved website performance for businesses of all sizes.
