## AWS CloudFront

AWS CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) offered by Amazon Web Services, designed to accelerate the delivery of websites, videos, applications, and APIs to users around the world with low latency and high transfer speeds. It works by caching static and dynamic content at edge locations strategically located in different regions worldwide, closer to users to reduce the distance data must travel. Additionally, CloudFront integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, making it easy to stream media, secure content with encryption, and customize delivery settings. With its scalability, flexibility, and ease of use, AWS CloudFront is a powerful tool for optimizing web performance and enhancing the overall user experience.
