## Apache Gobblin

Apache Gobblin is an open-source data integration framework that simplifies the process of ingesting large volumes of data from a variety of sources into a Data Lake. It provides a unified framework for managing the end-to-end data ingestion process, including data extraction, transformation, and loading. Apache Gobblin is designed to be scalable and fault-tolerant, making it ideal for handling large-scale data processing tasks in a reliable and efficient manner. Its modular architecture allows for easy customization and integration with other data processing tools and frameworks, making it a versatile solution for modern data engineering workflows.
