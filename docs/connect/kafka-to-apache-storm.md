## Apache Storm

Apache Storm is a real-time computation system that allows users to process massive streams of data in a fast and scalable manner. It is designed to be fault-tolerant and can handle large volumes of data with low latency. Apache Storm is commonly used for real-time analytics, stream processing, and continuous computation tasks. With its distributed architecture and parallel processing capabilities, Apache Storm can easily handle complex data processing tasks and provide real-time insights to users.
