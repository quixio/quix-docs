## CSS

Cascading Style Sheets, more commonly known as CSS, is a technology used in web development to control the visual presentation of a website. CSS allows web designers to separate the structure of a webpage from its appearance, making it easier to make changes to the design without affecting the underlying code. With CSS, designers can specify the layout, colors, fonts, and other design elements of a website, creating a consistent and professional look across all pages. CSS is essential in creating responsive and mobile-friendly websites, as it allows for flexible and dynamic layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Overall, CSS plays a crucial role in enhancing the user experience and improving the aesthetics of websites on the internet.
