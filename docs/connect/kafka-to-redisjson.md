Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house arthitectures, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## RedisJSON

RedisJSON is an extension module for Redis that allows users to store, query, and manipulate JSON data directly within the Redis database. This technology enables users to take advantage of the flexibility and simplicity of JSON data structures while harnessing the power and scalability of Redis. With RedisJSON, developers can easily work with complex nested JSON objects, perform advanced queries on their data, and seamlessly integrate JSON functionality into their existing Redis workflows. It's a game-changer for those looking to leverage the best of both worlds in their data storage and retrieval processes.
