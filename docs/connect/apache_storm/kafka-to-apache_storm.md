## Apache Storm

Apache Storm is a real-time computational engine that allows users to process large volumes of data in a fast and reliable manner. It is used for stream processing tasks such as data analytics, machine learning, and continuous computation. Storm is designed to be highly scalable, fault-tolerant, and easily integrated with other technologies. It utilizes a concept called "topology" to define data flow and processing logic, which can be distributed across multiple nodes in a cluster for parallel processing. Storm is widely used in various industries for real-time data processing and has become a popular choice for organizations looking to harness the power of big data for actionable insights.
