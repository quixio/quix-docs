## MariaDB

MariaDB is an open-source relational database management system that is a fork of MySQL. It was created by the original developers of MySQL after concerns arose about the acquisition of MySQL by Oracle Corporation. MariaDB is designed for high performance, scalability, and reliability, with features such as multi-version concurrency control and parallel replication. It maintains compatibility with MySQL, making it a popular choice for organizations looking to switch from MySQL without changing their existing applications. MariaDB is widely used in web development, data warehousing, and e-commerce applications, and is known for its community-driven development model and active developer community.
