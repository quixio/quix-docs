## MongoDB

MongoDB is a widely-used, open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database technology. It is designed to store data in a flexible, JSON-like format, making it easy to work with for developers. MongoDB uses a system of collections and documents, allowing for fast and efficient data retrieval and manipulation. It also provides features such as automatic sharding for scalability, replication for high availability, and a powerful query language for advanced data analysis. With its ability to handle large volumes of data and its flexibility in data modeling, MongoDB is a popular choice for modern web applications and big data projects.
