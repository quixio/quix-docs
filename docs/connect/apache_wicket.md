## Apache Wicket

Apache Wicket is a Java web application framework that simplifies the development of complex web applications by allowing developers to focus on creating reusable components. With its component-based approach, developers can easily create dynamic and interactive web pages without having to worry about the underlying HTML and JavaScript code. Apache Wicket is built on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, making it easy to separate business logic from presentation. It also provides support for internationalization, validation, and session management, making it a versatile and powerful framework for building modern web applications. Overall, Apache Wicket offers a flexible and efficient solution for developing web applications, making it a popular choice among Java developers.
