## AWS Service Catalog

AWS Service Catalog is a technology offered by Amazon Web Services that allows organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for use on the AWS platform. This technology enables administrators to define standardized portfolios of services, ranging from virtual machine images to software applications and databases, that can be easily provisioned by users within the organization. By centralizing the management of IT services and enforcing compliance with organizational policies, AWS Service Catalog helps improve efficiency, governance, and consistency across the entire organization's cloud infrastructure. With AWS Service Catalog, organizations can streamline the process of deploying and managing IT services on AWS, ultimately enhancing productivity and reducing operational costs.
