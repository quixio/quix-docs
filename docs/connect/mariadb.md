## MariaDB

MariaDB is an open-source, relational database management system that was created as a drop-in replacement for MySQL. It was developed by the original developers of MySQL after concerns about Oracle's acquisition of the MySQL project. MariaDB aims to maintain compatibility with MySQL while also offering additional features and enhancements. It provides high performance, scalability, and robust security features, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. MariaDB also supports a variety of storage engines, including InnoDB and Aria, allowing users to customize their database configurations to fit their specific needs. Additionally, MariaDB offers comprehensive support and documentation, making it a popular choice for organizations looking for a reliable and feature-rich database solution.
