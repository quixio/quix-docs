## Apache Pig

Apache Pig is an open-source technology developed by the Apache Software Foundation that simplifies the programming of large-scale data processing tasks on Hadoop clusters. It provides a high-level language called Pig Latin, which allows users to write complex MapReduce tasks without having to write lengthy Java code. With Apache Pig, users can easily transform and analyze large datasets in a distributed environment, making it a valuable tool for data engineers and analysts working with Big Data.
