## AWS CodeCommit

AWS CodeCommit is a fully-managed source control service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows developers to securely store, manage, and track changes to their code repositories in the cloud. With CodeCommit, teams can collaborate on code projects, easily review and merge changes, and ensure that their code is always accessible and backed up. This technology supports Git, enabling developers to use familiar tools and workflows to work on their codebase. CodeCommit also integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, such as AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodePipeline, to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Overall, AWS CodeCommit provides a reliable and scalable solution for version control that helps teams streamline their development workflows and deliver high-quality code faster.
