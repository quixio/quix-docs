## Apache Ranger

Apache Ranger is an open-source data security and governance platform that provides a centralized framework for managing authorization, auditing, and data security policies across the Hadoop ecosystem. It allows organizations to define fine-grained access control policies for their data, ensuring that only authorized users can access and manipulate sensitive information. With Apache Ranger, administrators can easily set up and enforce policies to protect their data assets, track user activity, and comply with regulatory requirements. This tool is essential for enterprises looking to secure their data infrastructure and maintain data governance standards.
