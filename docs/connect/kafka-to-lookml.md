Quix helps you integrate Apache Kafka with LookML using pure Python.

Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house architecture, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## LookML

LookML is a powerful data modeling language used in the Looker business intelligence platform. It provides users with a simplified way to define and organize the structure of their data, making it easier to generate meaningful insights and visualizations. With LookML, users can create reusable definitions for their data fields, establish relationships between different data sets, and customize the way data is displayed in reports and dashboards. This semantic layer abstraction enables non-technical users to query data more effectively and collaborate with data analysts and engineers in a more efficient manner. LookML empowers organizations to unlock the full potential of their data assets and drive informed decision-making at all levels.
