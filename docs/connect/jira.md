## Jira

Jira is a project management tool developed by Atlassian that is used by teams to plan, track, and manage their work. It is a comprehensive software solution that allows users to create tasks, assign them to team members, set deadlines, and track progress in real-time. Jira also offers customizability, allowing teams to tailor the software to fit their specific workflows and processes. With features such as kanban boards, scrum boards, and agile reporting, Jira is a versatile and powerful tool for managing projects of any size and complexity.
