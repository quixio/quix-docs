## Django

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, allowing users to focus on writing their app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Django includes features such as an intuitive admin panel, robust security options, and powerful tools for building scalable web applications. The framework follows a batteries-included philosophy, providing developers with everything they need to build a web application right out of the box. With Django's built-in tools and libraries, developers can create dynamic, database-driven websites with ease.
