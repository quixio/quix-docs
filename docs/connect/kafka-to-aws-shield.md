## AWS Shield

AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. It provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations to minimize application downtime and latency, allowing businesses to maintain availability and performance for their applications. With AWS Shield, customers can easily protect against common and larger-scale DDoS attacks, enabling them to focus on their core business initiatives without having to worry about potential disruptions caused by malicious traffic.
