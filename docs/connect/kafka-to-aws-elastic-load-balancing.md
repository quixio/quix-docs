## AWS Elastic Load Balancing

AWS Elastic Load Balancing is a highly advanced technology that allows for the automatic distribution of incoming application traffic across multiple targets. This service helps to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed with traffic, optimizing performance and reliability. By detecting unhealthy instances and rerouting traffic to healthy ones, AWS Elastic Load Balancing helps to prevent downtime and ensures that applications remain highly available. With its ability to scale in response to changing demands, this technology is a critical component for businesses looking to deliver seamless and dependable user experiences.
