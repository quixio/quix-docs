## Apache Druid

Apache Druid is an open-source, high-performance, and real-time analytical database designed for operational analytics at scale. It is capable of storing and processing large amounts of data in near real-time, making it ideal for use cases such as event-driven applications, IoT data analysis, and real-time monitoring. Druid uses a columnar storage format and distributed architecture to achieve fast query performance, enabling users to query and visualize data quickly and efficiently. With its ability to handle both historical and real-time data, Apache Druid is a popular choice for organizations looking for a scalable, low-latency solution for their data analytics needs.
