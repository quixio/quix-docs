## AWS Elastic Beanstalk

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a cloud computing service provided by Amazon Web Services that makes it easy for developers to deploy and manage applications in the cloud. With Elastic Beanstalk, developers can quickly upload their code and let the service handle the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of the application. This allows developers to focus on writing code and building their applications, rather than worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Elastic Beanstalk supports a variety of programming languages and frameworks, making it a versatile and convenient option for developers looking to streamline their deployment process.
