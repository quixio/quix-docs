## AWS Organizations

AWS Organizations is a technology provided by Amazon Web Services that helps businesses centrally manage and govern their multiple AWS accounts. With AWS Organizations, organizations can create groupings of accounts to easily manage policies, security settings, and resource sharing across all accounts. This technology helps businesses maintain control and compliance with security standards and cost management practices across their AWS infrastructure. By streamlining the management of multiple accounts, AWS Organizations enables organizations to optimize their cloud computing resources and improve operational efficiency. Additionally, AWS Organizations allows businesses to allocate resources more efficiently and securely, ultimately leading to better overall performance and cost savings.
