## Gatsby

Gatsby is a modern web development technology that allows developers to build fast and efficient websites. It is a static site generator that uses React for building dynamic web applications. Gatsby optimizes websites for speed and performance by generating static HTML files during the build process, which are then served to users when they visit the site. This results in lightning-fast load times and a smooth user experience. Gatsby also offers a rich ecosystem of plugins and themes that make it easy to customize and extend websites. Overall, Gatsby is a powerful tool for creating high-performing websites with modern technologies.
