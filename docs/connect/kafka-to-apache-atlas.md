## Apache Atlas

Apache Atlas is an open source technology that provides metadata management and governance capabilities for enterprises working with big data. Through its centralized metadata repository, Apache Atlas enables organizations to effectively classify, manage, and govern their data assets in a scalable and efficient manner. This powerful tool allows users to gain a comprehensive understanding of their data landscape, track data lineage, and ensure compliance with regulations and internal policies. By facilitating collaboration and integration with various data platforms, Apache Atlas empowers organizations to harness the full potential of their data assets while maintaining data quality and security.
