Quix helps you integrate Apache Kafka with AWS Polly using pure Python.

Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house architecture, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## AWS Polly

AWS Polly is a text-to-speech service that uses advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize speech that sounds like a human voice. With Polly, developers can easily add natural-sounding speech capabilities to their applications, enabling them to create interactive voice interfaces, convert text to speech in multiple languages and voices, and customize pronunciation for specific words. This robust technology offers a wide range of functionalities and can be seamlessly integrated with other AWS services to enhance user experiences and accessibility.
