## MySQL

MySQL is a widely used open-source relational database management system that is popular for its speed, reliability, and ease of use. It allows users to store and retrieve data efficiently, making it a valuable tool for web applications and other data-driven projects. MySQL uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to interact with the database, making it a flexible and powerful choice for developers and businesses alike. With features such as triggers, stored procedures, and user-defined functions, MySQL offers a robust solution for managing large sets of data effectively.
