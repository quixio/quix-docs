## AWS App Runner

AWS App Runner is a fully managed service offered by Amazon Web Services that allows developers to easily deploy, run, and scale containerized web applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. With App Runner, developers can simply provide their source code or container image, and the service takes care of everything else, including orchestrating the deployment, managing the application's scaling, and handling load balancing. App Runner also provides built-in integration with other AWS services, making it easy to connect to databases, storage, and other resources. This technology simplifies the process of deploying web applications, allowing developers to focus on writing code and building features rather than managing infrastructure.
