## XML-RPC

XML-RPC, or Extensible Markup Language Remote Procedure Call, is a protocol that allows for communication between different systems over the internet. It uses XML to encode data and HTTP as the transport mechanism. XML-RPC allows for remote procedure calls, where a client system can invoke methods or functions on a remote server and receive the results back. This technology is widely used for integrating different applications and systems, as well as enabling interoperability between different programming languages. XML-RPC is simple, lightweight, and easy to implement, making it a popular choice for web services and APIs.
