AWS Config is a powerful service offered by Amazon Web Services that allows users to continuously monitor and assess the configurations of their AWS resources. With AWS Config, users can track changes to their resource configurations in real-time, identify potential security vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance with organizational policies. This technology provides valuable insights into the current state of an organization's AWS environment, enabling users to make informed decisions and maintain control over their cloud infrastructure.
