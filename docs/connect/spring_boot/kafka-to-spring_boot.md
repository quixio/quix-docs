## Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a technology that simplifies the process of building and deploying Java-based applications. It provides a set of tools and libraries that allow developers to create standalone, production-ready applications with minimal configuration. Spring Boot is built on top of the popular Spring framework and allows for rapid development by providing defaults for most configurations, thus eliminating the need for complex setup. It also includes features such as embedded servers, which make it easy to deploy applications without the need for additional servers. Overall, Spring Boot is a powerful and efficient tool for developers looking to streamline the development process and create high-quality Java applications.
