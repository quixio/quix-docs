## AWS CloudTrail

AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables users to monitor and log AWS account activity. It provides a comprehensive history of API calls made within an AWS account, including actions taken by users, services, and applications. With CloudTrail, users can track changes to resources, detect unusual activity, and troubleshoot security incidents. This technology plays a crucial role in maintaining visibility and governance over AWS environments, helping organizations ensure compliance with security regulations and best practices.
