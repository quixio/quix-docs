Quix helps you integrate Apache Kafka with AWS CloudTrail using pure Python.

Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house architecture, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## AWS CloudTrail

AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables users to monitor and log AWS account activity. It provides a comprehensive history of API calls made within an AWS account, including actions taken by users, services, and applications. With CloudTrail, users can track changes to resources, detect unusual activity, and troubleshoot security incidents. This technology plays a crucial role in maintaining visibility and governance over AWS environments, helping organizations ensure compliance with security regulations and best practices.
