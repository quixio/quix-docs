## SQLite

SQLite is a powerful and lightweight relational database management system that is widely used in a variety of applications. It is known for its simplicity, speed, and reliability, making it popular among developers for embedding in software applications. SQLite stores data in a single file, making it easy to deploy and manage. It supports standard SQL syntax and transactions, making it suitable for both small-scale and large-scale database applications. With its small footprint and robust performance, SQLite is a valuable tool for developers looking to incorporate a database into their projects.
