## AWS EventBridge

AWS EventBridge is a serverless event bus service provided by Amazon Web Services that allows developers to easily connect and route data between different AWS services and external applications. It simplifies the process of creating event-driven architectures by enabling organizations to easily define event schemas, set up rules to trigger actions based on those events, and manage the flow of data across distributed systems. With EventBridge, developers can seamlessly integrate their applications and services, automate workflows, and build scalable and resilient event-driven architectures without having to worry about managing infrastructure or complex integration logic. Additionally, EventBridge supports a wide range of event sources, including AWS services, SaaS applications, custom applications, and more, making it a flexible and powerful tool for building modern, cloud-native applications.
