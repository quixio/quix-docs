## Apache VCL

Apache VCL, also known as the Virtual Computing Lab, is an open-source software platform that allows users to remotely access and control virtual machines. This technology enables users to access a variety of computing resources, such as applications, desktop environments, and operating systems, from any location with an internet connection. Apache VCL manages the provisioning, scheduling, and release of virtual machines, making it easier for organizations to manage their computing resources efficiently. With its flexible architecture and support for diverse operating systems and virtualization technologies, Apache VCL is a powerful tool for delivering virtualized computing services to users in a secure and scalable manner.

## Integrations
