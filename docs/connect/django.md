## Django

Django is a high-level, open-source web framework written in Python that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern and uses a clean, modular design that allows developers to focus on writing their application's business logic without having to reinvent the wheel. Django includes many built-in features such as an object-relational mapper for interacting with databases, a dynamic admin interface for managing content, and a powerful template language for building user interfaces. It also offers built-in security features, like protection against SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks, making it a popular choice for building secure and scalable web applications.
