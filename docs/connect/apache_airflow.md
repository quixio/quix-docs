## Apache Airflow

Apache Airflow is an open-source technology that is used for orchestrating complex workflows and data pipelines. It allows users to schedule, monitor, and manage their workflow tasks with ease. Airflow utilizes Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to define the order and dependencies of tasks, which can be easily visualized through its user-friendly interface. This technology supports various integrations with popular data storage and processing tools, making it a versatile and powerful solution for organizations looking to streamline their data workflows. Apache Airflow is highly scalable and fault-tolerant, making it ideal for managing large and mission-critical data pipelines.
