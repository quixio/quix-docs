## Bokeh

Bokeh is a photographic technique that refers to the aesthetic quality of the out-of-focus areas in a photo, typically in the background. This effect is achieved by using a shallow depth of field, where the subject is in sharp focus while the background is blurred. Bokeh creates a pleasing and visually appealing separation between the subject and its surroundings, emphasizing the main focal point of the image. This technique is often used in portrait photography to create a dreamy and romantic atmosphere, or in nature photography to enhance the beauty of a flower or landscape. Bokeh is popular among photographers for its ability to add depth and dimension to a picture, making it stand out and captivate viewers.
