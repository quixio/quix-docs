It is an open-source database that uses a document-oriented data model, making it ideal for handling large volumes of data across distributed systems. MongoDB's architecture allows for seamless horizontal scaling, enabling users to easily add or remove servers to accommodate changing workload demands. With its powerful query language and indexing capabilities, MongoDB is a popular choice for applications that require fast and efficient data retrieval.
