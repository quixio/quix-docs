## Apache Hadoop

Apache Hadoop is a powerful and widely-used open-source software framework designed for processing and analyzing large amounts of data across distributed computing environments. It utilizes a highly scalable and fault-tolerant architecture that allows users to store, process, and manage vast amounts of data efficiently. Hadoop consists of two main components: the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for storing data across multiple nodes, and the MapReduce programming model for processing and analyzing the data in parallel. This technology has revolutionized the way organizations handle big data by providing a cost-effective and reliable solution for storing, processing, and extracting valuable insights from massive datasets.
