Quix helps you integrate Apache Kafka with AWS Fargate using pure Python.

Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house architecture, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## AWS Fargate

AWS Fargate is a container orchestration service that allows users to run containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. With Fargate, users can focus on building and deploying applications without worrying about server provisioning, scaling, or patching. This technology provides a serverless compute engine that automatically scales based on application needs and only charges for the resources consumed. AWS Fargate simplifies the process of managing containers, making it easier for developers to deploy and run applications efficiently.
