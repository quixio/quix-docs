## AWS Config

AWS Config is a technology developed by Amazon Web Services that provides a detailed inventory and configuration history of resources within an AWS account. It continuously monitors and evaluates the configurations of AWS resources and alerts users of any discrepancies or non-compliance with best practices. AWS Config helps organizations maintain a secure and compliant environment by tracking changes, managing the configuration of resources, and providing a timeline of events for easy troubleshooting. This technology allows users to gain better visibility into their infrastructure, improve compliance, and ensure their resources are consistently configured according to predefined standards.
