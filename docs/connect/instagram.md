## Instagram

Instagram is a social media platform that allows users to share photos and video content with their followers. It was founded in 2010 and quickly gained popularity for its user-friendly interface and visual-centric design. Users can upload photos or videos, apply filters and editing effects, and add captions before sharing them on their profile. Followers can like, comment, and share content, creating a sense of community and interaction. Instagram also offers features like Stories, Reels, and IGTV, allowing for even more creative expression and engagement. With over a billion active users worldwide, Instagram has become a powerful tool for connecting with others, expressing creativity, and discovering new content.
