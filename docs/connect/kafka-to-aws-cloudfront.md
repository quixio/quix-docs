## AWS CloudFront

AWS CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It accelerates the delivery of web content to users by caching data at edge locations closer to the end-users. This helps reduce latency and improve overall website performance. AWS CloudFront integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, providing a scalable and reliable solution for distributing content globally. In addition to speeding up content delivery, it also helps protect against malicious attacks and ensures a secure and reliable experience for end-users accessing web applications and websites.
