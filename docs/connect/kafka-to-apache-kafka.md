Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house architecture, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform designed to handle real-time data feeds. It provides a high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable messaging system that allows users to publish, subscribe, store, and process streams of records. Kafka is widely used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications, enabling companies to efficiently process and analyze large volumes of data in a timely manner. With its ability to handle trillions of events per day, Kafka has become a crucial component for organizations looking to harness the power of data in today's fast-paced digital world.
