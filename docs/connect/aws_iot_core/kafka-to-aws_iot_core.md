## AWS IoT Core

AWS IoT Core is a technology developed by Amazon Web Services that provides a platform for connecting devices to the cloud. It allows for secure and bi-directional communication between devices and the cloud, making it easier to collect, manage, and analyze data from connected devices. With AWS IoT Core, users can create rules to trigger actions based on data received from devices, as well as securely and efficiently manage large fleets of devices. This technology is scalable and highly reliable, making it ideal for a wide range of IoT applications across industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, and smart home automation.
