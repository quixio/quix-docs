## Vonage

Vonage is a voice-over-internet-protocol (VoIP) technology that allows users to make phone calls over the internet rather than through traditional phone lines. This technology has revolutionized the way people communicate by providing a more cost-effective and flexible option for making calls. Vonage offers features such as call forwarding, voicemail transcription, and virtual receptionists, making it ideal for businesses and individuals looking for a reliable and efficient phone service. With Vonage, users can make calls from anywhere in the world as long as they have an internet connection, making it a convenient and portable communication solution.
