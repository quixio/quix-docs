## Apache Marmotta

Apache Marmotta is an open-source platform that provides a linked data database and integrates various data sources on the web. It allows users to store and query interconnected data using semantic web technologies. Apache Marmotta supports the RDF (Resource Description Framework) data model and provides APIs for managing and querying linked data. It also includes a web-based user interface for exploring the linked data repository. Apache Marmotta is a powerful tool for building linked data applications and facilitating data integration and interoperability on the web.
