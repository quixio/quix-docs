## Rust

Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on safety, speed, and concurrency. Developed by Mozilla, Rust is designed to prevent common programming errors such as null pointer dereferencing, buffer overflows, and memory leaks. Its unique ownership system allows for memory safety without the need for a garbage collector, making it suitable for low-level programming tasks. Rust also boasts a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that make it easier for developers to build robust and efficient software. Overall, Rust is a powerful and versatile technology that is gaining popularity among developers for its reliability and performance.
