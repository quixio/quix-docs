## AWS CloudFormation

AWS CloudFormation is a powerful technology that allows users to create and manage a collection of AWS resources in a repeatable and efficient manner. With CloudFormation, users can define their infrastructure as code using a JSON or YAML template, allowing them to easily provision resources such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and VPCs in a controlled and automated way. This technology enables users to quickly deploy and update their infrastructure, ensuring consistency and reliability across their AWS environment. CloudFormation also provides the ability to rollback changes in case of any errors, making it a valuable tool for managing complex and dynamic infrastructures in the cloud.
