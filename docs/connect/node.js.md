## Node.js

Node.js is a popular open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient for building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js is versatile and can be used for a wide range of applications, from server-side web applications to command-line tools. Its package manager, npm, is one of the largest software registries in the world, providing developers with a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools to enhance their projects. Overall, Node.js is a powerful technology that has revolutionized the way JavaScript is used for server-side programming.
