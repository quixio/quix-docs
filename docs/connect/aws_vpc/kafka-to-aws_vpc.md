## AWS VPC

AWS VPC, or Amazon Web Services Virtual Private Cloud, is a technology that allows users to provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon cloud where they can launch AWS resources in a virtual network. With AWS VPC, users have control over their virtual networking environment, including selection of IP address ranges, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. This technology provides a secure and private environment for users to deploy their applications and resources, with the ability to connect their VPC to their on-premises network using a VPN or Direct Connect connection. AWS VPC is highly scalable, flexible, and customizable, making it a powerful tool for building and managing cloud-based infrastructures.
