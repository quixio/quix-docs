## AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)

AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a cloud-based storage service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to create and manage block storage volumes for their virtual machines in the cloud. EBS volumes are highly reliable and scalable, allowing users to easily adjust the size and performance of their storage based on their needs. With EBS, users can also take advantage of features like snapshots, which enable them to back up and restore their data quickly and efficiently. EBS is designed to be highly available and durable, ensuring that users can access their data whenever they need it.
