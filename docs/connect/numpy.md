## NumPy

NumPy is a popular open-source library in Python that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It is widely used in scientific computing, machine learning, and data analysis applications due to its efficient implementation of array manipulation and numerical computations. NumPy is built on top of the C programming language, making it fast and efficient for handling large amounts of data. Additionally, NumPy seamlessly integrates with other libraries in the Python eco-system, such as pandas and SciPy, making it a valuable tool for data manipulation and analysis tasks.
