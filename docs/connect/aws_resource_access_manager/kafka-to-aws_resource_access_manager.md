## AWS Resource Access Manager

AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) is a technology offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to share AWS resources across accounts. With RAM, organizations can centrally manage access to shared resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Aurora databases, and Amazon S3 buckets. This simplifies resource sharing among different AWS accounts within the same organization, making it easier to collaborate and reduce duplication of resources. RAM also allows users to choose which resources to share and specify the level of access granted to different accounts. This technology enhances security and scalability for organizations using multiple AWS accounts by providing a unified way to manage and share resources.
