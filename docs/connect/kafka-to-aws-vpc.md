## AWS VPC

AWS VPC (Amazon Virtual Private Cloud) is a powerful networking service offered by Amazon Web Services that allows users to create isolated virtual private networks within the cloud environment. With AWS VPC, users can define their own virtual network topology, configure IP addresses, subnets, and routing tables, and manage security settings through the use of network access control lists and security groups. This technology provides a high level of control and security over cloud resources, making it ideal for organizations looking to securely connect their on-premises infrastructure to the cloud.
