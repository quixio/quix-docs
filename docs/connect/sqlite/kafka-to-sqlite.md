## SQLite

SQLite is a powerful and lightweight relational database management system that is designed for embedded use within applications. It is known for its small footprint, ease of use, and high performance, making it a popular choice for mobile devices and other applications that require a local database. SQLite supports most standard SQL commands, allowing developers to easily interact with the database using familiar commands. Additionally, SQLite is self-contained, meaning it requires no separate server process or configuration, making it simple to deploy and manage. Overall, SQLite is a versatile and reliable technology that is well-suited for a wide range of applications.
