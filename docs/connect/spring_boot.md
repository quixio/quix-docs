## Spring Boot

Spring Boot is an open-source framework that simplifies the process of building, deploying, and running standalone, production-ready applications based on the Spring framework. It provides a streamlined experience for developers by offering pre-configured settings, automatic configuration, and a range of starter projects that quickly set up the necessary dependencies for a variety of development tasks. Spring Boot allows developers to easily create microservices, web applications, and RESTful APIs with minimal setup and configuration, making it a popular choice for modern software development projects. Its emphasis on convention over configuration and opinionated defaults make Spring Boot an efficient and user-friendly option for developing robust and scalable applications.
