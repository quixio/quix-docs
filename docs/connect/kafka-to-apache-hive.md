Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house arthitectures, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## Apache Hive

Apache Hive is a data warehouse software that facilitates querying and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage. It provides a SQL-like interface to query the data, making it easy for users familiar with SQL to interact with big data. Hive translates queries into MapReduce jobs, taking advantage of the scalability and parallel processing capabilities of Hadoop. With its ability to handle petabytes of data across thousands of nodes, Apache Hive is a powerful tool for organizations looking to analyze and derive insights from their big data repositories.
