## Perl

Perl is a high-level, general-purpose interpreted programming language known for its flexibility and ease of use. It was developed in the late 1980s by Larry Wall and has since become a popular choice for tasks ranging from simple text processing to web development. Perl's syntax draws inspiration from various programming languages, including C, AWK, and shell scripting, making it versatile and powerful. It supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms, allowing developers to create efficient and scalable code for a wide range of applications. With its robust set of built-in functions and support for external libraries, Perl remains a valuable tool for programmers looking to solve complex problems efficiently.
