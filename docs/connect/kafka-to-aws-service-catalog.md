Quix helps you integrate Apache Kafka with AWS Service Catalog using pure Python.

Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house architecture, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## AWS Service Catalog

The AWS Service Catalog is a powerful tool that allows organizations to centrally manage and govern their IT services. It provides a standardized way to create, manage, and distribute approved products and services to end users. With AWS Service Catalog, IT administrators can easily control which services are available to users, set constraints on resource usage, and automate the deployment of resources. This helps organizations maintain compliance, improve efficiency, and streamline the process of delivering IT services to their users.
