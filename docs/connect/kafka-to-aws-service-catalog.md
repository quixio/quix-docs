## AWS Service Catalog

AWS Service Catalog is a powerful tool offered by Amazon Web Services that allows organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for use on their cloud environment. This technology enables IT administrators to centrally manage and distribute approved software, virtual machine images, server configurations, and other resources, making it easy for users to quickly deploy the resources they need while ensuring compliance with company policies. With AWS Service Catalog, organizations can increase efficiency, reduce costs, and improve governance over their cloud resources.
