## AWS Snowball

AWS Snowball is a data transfer device offered by Amazon Web Services that allows users to transfer large amounts of data to and from the cloud in a secure and efficient manner. This rugged, tamper-resistant device is designed to withstand harsh environments and can transfer up to 80 terabytes of data at a time. Users can simply plug in the device, transfer their data, and then ship it back to AWS for uploading to their cloud storage. With AES-256 bit encryption and built-in security features, AWS Snowball ensures that data transfers are safe and protected throughout the entire process. This technology is ideal for organizations that need to migrate large volumes of data quickly and securely.
