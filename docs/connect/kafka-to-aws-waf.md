## AWS WAF

AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) is a cloud-based security service that helps protect web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. It allows customers to define customizable web security rules that control which traffic can reach their web applications, which helps to block common attack patterns such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. AWS WAF is fully integrated with AWS CloudFront and AWS Application Load Balancer, making it simple to deploy and manage security rules across all of your web applications running on AWS.
