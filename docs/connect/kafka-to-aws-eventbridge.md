## AWS EventBridge

AWS EventBridge is a powerful event-driven service that allows developers to easily build applications that respond to events from various AWS services and custom sources. With EventBridge, users can create rules to route events to specific targets such as AWS Lambda functions, Amazon SNS topics, Amazon SQS queues, and more. This event-driven architecture simplifies the process of building scalable and resilient applications by allowing developers to focus on writing business logic rather than managing the underlying infrastructure. AWS EventBridge provides a flexible and reliable way to connect and automate workflows across different services and applications in the AWS cloud.
