## Apache XML-RPC

Apache XML-RPC is a versatile and powerful technology used for transmitting data between different systems over the internet. It provides a way for software programs to communicate with each other regardless of the programming language or platform they are built on. Using XML as the data format, Apache XML-RPC allows for easy serialization and deserialization of data, making it a reliable choice for web services and remote procedure calls. It also supports a wide range of data types and can be easily extended to include custom data structures. With its open-source nature and strong community support, Apache XML-RPC is a popular choice for building robust and scalable distributed systems.
