Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house arthitectures, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## Apache Metron

Apache Metron is an open source big data cybersecurity platform that helps organizations detect, investigate, and respond to cybersecurity threats in real-time. It combines a variety of technologies including Apache Storm for real-time data processing, Apache Hadoop for data storage and batch processing, and Apache Kafka for data ingestion. Apache Metron utilizes machine learning algorithms and threat intelligence feeds to analyze huge volumes of data from various sources such as network packets, logs, and telemetry data to identify potential security incidents and provide timely alerts to security analysts. This powerful tool is essential for organizations looking to enhance their cybersecurity defenses and protect against evolving threats.
