Kafka      ->  React
Producer   ->  Components
Consumer   ->  State Management (eg. Redux)
```

## React

React is an open-source JavaScript library developed and maintained by Facebook. It is widely used for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. React allows developers to create interactive, reusable components that can be easily updated when data changes. It combines the efficiency of virtual DOM rendering with a simple and declarative programming model, making it a popular choice for front-end development. React's component-based architecture and lifecycle methods provide developers with a powerful toolset for building dynamic and responsive web applications. Additionally, React's strong ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community support has made it a versatile and widely adopted technology for modern web development.
