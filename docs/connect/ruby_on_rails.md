## Ruby on Rails

Ruby on Rails, often shortened to Rails, is a web application framework written in the Ruby programming language. It follows the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern and provides developers with a variety of tools and libraries to streamline the development process. Rails emphasizes convention over configuration, allowing developers to quickly build and deploy robust web applications with minimal configuration. It also includes features such as automated testing, code generation, and scaffolding to speed up development. Known for its simplicity and readability, Ruby on Rails is a popular choice for startups and small businesses looking to create dynamic and scalable web applications.
