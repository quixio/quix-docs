## Google Drive

Google Drive is a cloud-based storage and file-sharing platform developed by Google. It allows users to store files, documents, and photos online, and access them from any device with an internet connection. Users can create, edit, and collaborate on files in real-time with others, making it a convenient tool for team projects and remote work. Google Drive also offers seamless integration with other Google services, such as Gmail and Google Docs, making it easy to save and share files directly from these applications. With generous storage space and robust security features, Google Drive is a versatile and reliable solution for file management and collaboration.
