## AWS CodeBuild

AWS CodeBuild is a cloud-based continuous integration service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that automates the building and testing of code repositories. It allows developers to easily compile, test, and deploy code without the need for manual intervention. CodeBuild supports a variety of programming languages and build tools, making it flexible and accessible for a wide range of projects. With its scalability and pay-as-you-go pricing model, CodeBuild is a cost-effective solution for teams looking to streamline their development processes and improve overall efficiency. By eliminating the manual effort involved in building and testing code, AWS CodeBuild helps developers focus on writing quality code and delivering projects faster.
