## AWS Polly

AWS Polly is a text-to-speech service offered by Amazon Web Services that allows users to convert written text into natural-sounding speech in a variety of languages and voices. Using advanced deep learning technologies, Polly can generate lifelike speech that is indistinguishable from human speech, with features such as intonation, rhythm, and emotion. Users can customize the voice, pronunciation, and volume of the speech output to create a personalized and engaging listening experience. With Polly, businesses can enhance their products and services by adding voice capabilities, improve accessibility for users with disabilities, and create interactive and engaging experiences for their customers.
