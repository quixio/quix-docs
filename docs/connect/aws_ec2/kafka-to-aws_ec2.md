## AWS EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a popular cloud computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). EC2 allows users to rent virtual servers, known as instances, on-demand for various computing needs. These instances can be easily scaled up or down based on the user's requirements, offering flexibility and cost-effectiveness. EC2 also provides a wide range of instance types to cater to different workloads, including general-purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, and storage-optimized instances. Additionally, users have access to a wide selection of operating systems and software applications to run on their EC2 instances. Overall, AWS EC2 is a powerful and versatile technology that enables businesses and individuals to easily deploy and manage virtual servers in the cloud.
