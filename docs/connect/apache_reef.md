## Apache REEF

Apache REEF (Retainable Evaluator Execution Framework) is a technology developed for efficiently handling and processing large-scale data sets in distributed computing environments. It provides a flexible and scalable framework that allows users to write and deploy data-intensive applications on a variety of computing resources, such as clusters and cloud platforms. REEF abstracts away the complexity of managing the underlying infrastructure and resources, allowing developers to focus on writing the logic for their applications. By providing an easy-to-use programming model and runtime environment, Apache REEF simplifies the development and deployment of complex data processing applications, making it an essential tool for organizations looking to harness the power of big data.
