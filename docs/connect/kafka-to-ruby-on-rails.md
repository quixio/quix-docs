## Ruby on Rails

Ruby on Rails, often simply referred to as Rails, is a web application framework written in Ruby. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, allowing for the separation of concerns within an application. Rails emphasizes convention over configuration, providing developers with a set of default structures and conventions to streamline the development process. With built-in tools and libraries, Rails makes common tasks such as database management, routing, and authentication simpler and more efficient. Overall, Ruby on Rails is a powerful framework that enables developers to quickly build and deploy web applications with ease.
