Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house architecture, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## Apache Kylin

Apache Kylin is an open-source distributed analytics engine designed to provide instant response times for extremely large datasets. It is specifically built for interactive big data analytics, supporting various query interfaces like SQL and multi-dimensional analysis (OLAP). With its ability to automatically create cube models and pre-calculate aggregate values, Apache Kylin enables users to efficiently query vast amounts of data in real-time. This technology is perfect for organizations looking to accelerate their analytical processing and gain valuable insights from their big data sources.
