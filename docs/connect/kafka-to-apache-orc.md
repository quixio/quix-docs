Quix helps you integrate Apache Kafka with Apache ORC using pure Python.

Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house arthitectures, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## Apache ORC

Apache ORC (Optimized Row Columnar) is a high-performance columnar storage format for Hadoop and other Big Data systems. It is designed to significantly improve query performance and reduce storage costs by optimizing analytical workloads. ORC files contain columnar data that is compressed and encoded for efficient processing, making them ideal for data warehousing and analytics applications. The format is highly flexible and supports complex data structures, making it a popular choice for organizations looking to streamline their Big Data processing pipelines. Its advanced features such as predicate pushdown, dictionary encoding, and data type evolution make it a powerful tool for managing and analyzing large datasets with ease.
