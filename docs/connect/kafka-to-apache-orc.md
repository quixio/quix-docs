Quix helps you integrate Apache Kafka with Apache Airflow using pure Python.

Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house arthitectures, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## Apache ORC

The Apache ORC (Optimized Row Columnar) format is a high-performance columnar storage format for Hadoop. It is designed to provide a compact, efficient way to store and process large amounts of data. Apache ORC is optimized for high performance analytics, with features such as predicate pushdown and column projection that allow for efficient query processing. The format is also highly compatible with other Apache projects such as Hive and Spark, making it a versatile tool for data processing and analysis. With its ability to compress data and improve query performance, Apache ORC is a valuable technology for organizations dealing with big data challenges.
