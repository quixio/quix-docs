## AWS X-Ray

AWS X-Ray is a powerful debugging and analysis tool provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows developers to trace requests as they travel through various microservices and identify performance bottlenecks or errors. With AWS X-Ray, developers can gain insights into their applications' architecture, understand how different components interact with each other, and optimize their code for better efficiency. This technology revolutionizes the way developers diagnose and troubleshoot issues in distributed systems, making it an essential tool for anyone working with complex cloud-based applications.
