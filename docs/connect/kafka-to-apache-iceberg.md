Quix helps you integrate Apache Kafka with Apache Airflow using pure Python.

Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house arthitectures, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## Apache Iceberg

Apache Iceberg is a cutting-edge data table format that provides users with the ability to manage large-scale, complex data sets in a more efficient and structured manner. This technology allows for the separation of data storage and processing, enabling users to query and analyze data without having to reprocess entire datasets. With its support for nested data and schema evolution, Apache Iceberg offers a flexible and scalable solution for managing data lakes and data warehouses. Its innovative design and advanced features make it a valuable tool for organizations looking to optimize their data management processes.
