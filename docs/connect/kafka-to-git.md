## Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to efficiently manage and track changes to their codebase. Developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git has become the industry standard for collaborating on software projects. With its ability to create branches, merge changes, and track revision history, Git enables developers to work simultaneously on different parts of a project without fear of losing or overwriting each other's work. Additionally, Git provides a secure and reliable platform for storing code, ensuring that developers can easily revert to previous versions if needed.
