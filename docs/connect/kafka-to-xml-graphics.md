Quix helps you integrate Apache Kafka with XML Graphics using pure Python.

Transform and pre-process data, with the new alternative to Confluent Kafka Connect, before loading it into a specific format, simplifying data lake house architecture, reducing storage and ownership costs and enabling data teams to achieve success for your business.

## XML Graphics

XML Graphics is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding visual data in a format that is both human-readable and machine-understandable. This technology allows users to create and display graphical content, such as images, charts, diagrams, and vector graphics, in a flexible and extensible manner. XML Graphics leverages the power of XML to provide a standardized way of representing graphic information, making it easier for applications to exchange and process visual data. By using XML Graphics, developers can design sophisticated graphics that are scalable, customizable, and accessible across different platforms and devices.
