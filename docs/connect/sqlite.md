## SQLite

SQLite is a lightweight, open-source, relational database management system that is self-contained and requires no server or configuration. It is compatible with all major operating systems and programming languages, making it a versatile solution for developers. SQLite is known for its simplicity and ease of use, as it allows users to store, retrieve, and manipulate data with SQL commands. Despite its small footprint, SQLite is powerful enough to handle complex database operations and is often used in mobile applications, embedded systems, and small-scale websites. Overall, SQLite is a reliable and efficient technology that provides a straightforward way to manage data without the need for a dedicated server.
