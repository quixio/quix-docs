## Laravel

Laravel is a popular open-source PHP framework used for web application development. It provides a range of features that make building complex web applications faster and easier. Laravel follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, making it easy to separate concerns and ensure clean and organized code. It offers features like routing, authentication, sessions, and caching out of the box, reducing the need for developers to implement these features manually. Laravel also has a robust ecosystem of libraries, packages, and tools that can further enhance the development process, making it a favorite choice for many developers working on web projects.
