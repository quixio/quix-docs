With CloudTrail, organizations can easily track changes made to their resources, identify unauthorized activities, and investigate security incidents by analyzing the log data. This technology also enables users to streamline compliance efforts by automatically documenting actions and allowing for easy retrieval of historical data. Overall, AWS CloudTrail is an essential tool for ensuring the security and integrity of AWS environments.
