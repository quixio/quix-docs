## Apache Xalan

Apache Xalan is an open-source implementation of the XSLT (extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) and XPath (XML Path Language) specifications. It is designed to transform XML files into various formats such as HTML, plain text, or other XML documents. Apache Xalan allows developers to create powerful and flexible transformations of XML data by applying stylesheets and rules defined in XSLT. It provides support for complex transformations, including sorting, grouping, and manipulating XML elements and attributes. Apache Xalan is widely used in web development and data processing applications to generate dynamic content and transform XML data for presentation and analysis.
