Developed by Twitter, Bootstrap is an open-source technology that includes templates, CSS and JavaScript components, and a grid system that enables users to build a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. With Bootstrap, developers can easily customize the look and feel of their projects, as well as ensure they are compatible with various devices and screen sizes. This technology has gained popularity among developers due to its ease of use and flexibility, making it a valuable tool for creating modern and professional websites.
