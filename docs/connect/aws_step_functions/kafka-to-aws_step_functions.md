## AWS Step Functions

AWS Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to easily coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices through visual workflows. With Step Functions, developers can create complex state machines that define the sequence of steps required to execute various tasks in a workflow. These state machines can integrate with AWS services such as Lambda functions, S3 storage, DynamoDB databases, and more. Step Functions provides robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and logging, making it easier for developers to build resilient and scalable applications. Additionally, the service offers monitoring and visualization tools to track the progress of workflows and troubleshoot any issues that may arise. Overall, AWS Step Functions simplifies the process of orchestrating distributed systems and helps developers build more reliable and efficient applications.
