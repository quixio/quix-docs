# Code Samples

The Quix Portal includes a Library of templates and sample projects that
you can use to start working with the platform.

Quix allows explore the samples and save them as a new Project and immediately Run or Deploy them. If you don’t have a Quix account yet, go [sign-up to Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.ai/self-sign-up?xlink=docs){target=_blank} and create one.

The backend of the Quix Library is handled by a public [Open source repository](https://github.com/quixai/quix-library){target=_blank} on GitHub, so you can become a contributor of our Library generating new samples or updating existing ones.
