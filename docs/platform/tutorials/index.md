- __Use data science to predict availability__

    ---
    
    Learn how to deploy a real-time **data science** project into a scalable self-maintained solution. You create a service that predicts bicycle availability in New York, by building the raw data ingestion pipelines, Extract Transform Load (ETL), and predictions.
