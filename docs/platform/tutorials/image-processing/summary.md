* If you decide to build your own connectors and apps, you can contribute something to the Quix Library. Visit the [Quix GitHub](https://github.com/quixai/quix-library){target=_blank}. Fork our library repo and submit your code, updates, and ideas.

What will you build? Let us know! Weâ€™d love to feature your project or use case in our [newsletter](https://www.quix.io/community/).
