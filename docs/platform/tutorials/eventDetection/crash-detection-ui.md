## Deploying the UI

The following steps demonstrate how to select the UI from the Samples Library and deploy it to your Quix workspace.

Follow these steps to deploy the prebuilt UI:

1. Navigate to the Library and search for `Event Detection Demo UI`.

2. Click the `Setup & deploy` button.

3. Ensure that the `topic` input box contains `phone-data`.

	This topic will be subscribed to and will contain the sensor data from the data source you deployed earlier.

4. Ensure that the `eventTopic` input contains `phone-out`.

	This topic will be subscribed to and will contain any events generated by the crash event detection service you deployed earlier.

5. Click `Deploy` and wait while the UI is deployed and started.
	You will be redirected to your workspace homepage once it's completed.

!!! success

6. Click the "open in new window" button on the `Crash Detection Demo UI` tile.

		You will need some data streaming into the `phone-data` topic for the UI to activate. 
		
		Ensure the services you deployed in the previous stages of this tutorial are up and running. Have your phone to hand or make sure the [CSV data source](./data-acquisition.md#csv-data) is running

	a. The map showing the location reported by your phone or from the prerecorded data.

	b. Telemetry data from your phone.

	c. The timestamp of any crash events.
