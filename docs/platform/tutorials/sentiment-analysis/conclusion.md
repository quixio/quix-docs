# Conclusion

You’ve just made extensive use of the Quix library, our collection of open source connectors, and examples, to deploy a UI and sentiment analysis microservice, and subscribe to Tweets.

Congratulations, that's quite an achievement!

## Next Steps

Here are some suggested next steps to continue on your Quix learning journey:

* If you want to build your own sentiment analysis service, rather than use a prebuilt service, you can learn how in the optional tutorial part [how to code a sentiment analysis service](code-and-deploy-sentiment-service.md).

* If you want to customize the Sentiment Demo UI, you can learn how in the optional tutorial part [how to customize the UI](customize-the-ui.md).

* If you decide to build your own connectors and apps, you can contribute something to the Quix Library. Visit the [Quix GitHub](https://github.com/quixai/quix-library){target=_blank}. Fork our library repo and submit your code, updates, and ideas.

What will you build? Let us know! We’d love to feature your project or use case in our [newsletter](https://www.quix.io/community/).
