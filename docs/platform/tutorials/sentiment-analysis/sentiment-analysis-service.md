This service uses the Hugging Face model to calculate sentiment for messages, and these are then displayed on the web UI.

## 💡 Key ideas

The key ideas on this page:

* Hugging Face model is used to generate sentiment values
* Sentiment analysis service subscribes to two topics and publishes to two topics
* How to examone message formats

## What it does

The sentiment analysis service uses a prebuilt model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/){target=_blank} to analyze the sentiment of each message flowing through the service.

The sentiment analysis service subscribes to the `messages` and `drafts` topics. The messages and draft messages are generated by the web UI. 

After sentiment analysis performed by the Hugging Face model, sentiment values are published to the `sentiment` and `drafts_sentiment` topics. The UI subscribes to these topics, and can then display the setiment values in the UI.

## 👩‍🔬 Lab - Examine messages 

There are several ways to view live data. This lab shows one way to do it. 

1. Click on `Topics` in the main left-hand navigation.

2. Where you see live data for the `messages` topic, click in that area, as shown in the screenshot:

    ![View live data](./images/topics-view-live-data.png){width=80%}

    You are taken to the live view of the Quix Data Explorer.

3. The `messages` topic is preselected for you. The stream names are the user names that you entered, or are user names from the Twitch service. Select any one and then select the `chat-message` parameter.

4. Click the `Messages` view, and then click on any real-time message displayed. In the message code view you see something similar to the following:

    ``` json
    {
    "Epoch": 0,
    "Timestamps": [
        1695303751958000000
    ],
    "NumericValues": {},
    "StringValues": {
        "chat-message": [
        "Can you check on my order please?"
        ]
    },
    "BinaryValues": {},
    "TagValues": {
        "room": [
        "channel"
        ],
        "name": [
        "gabbybe"
        ],
        "role": [
        "Customer"
        ]
    }
    }
    ```
