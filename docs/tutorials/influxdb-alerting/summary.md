# Summary

In this tutorial you have learned how to build a pipeline to get your laptop CPU load data into InfluxDB using Quix Streams. 

You have also seen how to add threshold detection to your pipeline, and built a PagerDuty destination to make sure alerts go to the engineer on duty.

## Next steps

* Quix Cloud Tour demonstrates [building alerting](../../quix-cloud/quixtour/serve-sms.md) from scratch with the Vonage APIs, which are simple to use.
* The Predictive maintenance project tutorial demonstrates [building alerting systems](../../tutorials/predictive-maintenance/overview.md) for equipment failure detection.
* [Quix Integrations documentation](../../integrations/overview.md)
