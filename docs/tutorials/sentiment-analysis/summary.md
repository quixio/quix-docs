# Summary

In this tutorial you've:

* Learned how to fork a GitHub repository and then integrate it with Quix
* Examined the code for several services in the pipeline
* Learned that web apps can read and write to Quix topics using the Quix Streaming APIs.
* Used the message view in the Quix UI to examine messages flowing on topics
* Created a customization to the UI on a feature environment (branch) and then seen how to merge that to the `tutorial` branch

## Next Steps

Here are some suggested next steps to continue on your Quix learning journey:

* Try the [computer vision tutorial](../computer-vision/overview.md).

* If you decide to build your own connectors and apps, you can contribute to the [Code Samples repository](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples){target=_blank}. Fork our Code Samples repo and submit your code, updates, and ideas.

What will you build? Let us know! We’d love to feature your application or use case in our [newsletter](https://www.quix.io/community/).
