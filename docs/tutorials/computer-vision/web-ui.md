# Web UI

    This tutorial is out of date. Please check the [tutorials overview](../overview.md) for our latest tutorials.

In this part of the tutorial you learn about the web UI service.

This provides the rather fancy interface for you to interact with this project.

## üí° Key ideas

The key ideas on this page:

* How a web client can read data from a Quix topic using Quix Streaming Reader API
* WebSockets as a way of streaming data into a web client
* Microsoft SignalR is the WebSockets technology used in the Streaming Reader API
* Access an external web application from the pipeline view

## What it does

The key thing this service does is provide a UI that enables you to see vehicle data in real time, displayed on a Google map.

The UI is an Angular web client written using Typescript. The most important thing to understand is how this service obtains data from the Quix pipeline. This is done through use of the [Quix Streaming Reader API](../../apis/streaming-reader-api/overview.md). 

The Streaming Reader API has both an HTTP and WebSockets interface you can use to interface with a Quix topic. This web client uses the WebSockets interface. This enables data to be streamed from the Quix topic into the web client with good performance. This is a more efficient method than using the request-response method of HTTP.

The WebSockets interface uses Microsoft SignalR technology. You can read more about that in the [Quix SignalR documentation](../../apis/streaming-reader-api/setup.md#set-up-signalr) for the Reader API.

In essence the code to read a topic needs to:

1. Connect to Quix SignalR hub.
2. The web UI reads parameter data rather than event data, as that is the format used for inbound data in this case.
3. Handle "parameter data received" events using a callback.

The web UI code to do this is similar to the following:

``` javascript
ngAfterViewInit(): void {
this.getInitialData();

this.quixService.initCompleted$.subscribe((topicName) => {
    this._topicName = topicName;

    this.quixService.ConnectToQuix().then(connection => {
    this.connection = connection;
    this.connection.on('ParameterDataReceived', (data: ParameterData) => {
        this._parameterDataReceived$.next(data);
    });
    this.subscribeToData();

    this.connection.onreconnected((connectionId?: string) => {
        if (connectionId) this.subscribeToData();
    });
    });
});
```

So, simplifying, after connection to the Quix topic, on a `ParameterDataReceived` event, the corresponding callback (event) handler is invoked. There are other events that can be subscribed to. You can read more about events and subscription in the [subscription and event documentation](../../apis/streaming-reader-api/subscriptions.md).

!!! note

    In this app you only consume (read) data from Quix topics. 

The data read from the topic is as follows:

``` json
{
  "Epoch": 0,
  "Timestamps": [
    1693573934793346000
  ],
  "NumericValues": {
    "car": [
      7
    ],
    "traffic light": [
      1
    ],
    "person": [
      3
    ],
    "lat": [
      51.5107
    ],
    "lon": [
      -0.11512
    ],
    "delta": [
      -4.353343725204468
    ]
  },
  "StringValues": {
    "image": [
        "iVBO‚Ä¶to/v37HG18UyZ1Qz/fby/<snipped>+yXUGc5UVWZfIHnX0iqM6aEAAAAASUVORK5CYII="
    ]
  },
  "TagValues": {
    "parent_streamId": [
      "JamCams_00001.02500"
    ]
  }
}
```

The interesting thing here is that the detected object image to be displayed by the UI is passed to it in Base64 encoded format, as the HTTP interface of the streaming reader API is being used.

## Understand the code

You learned how to explore the code for a service in previous parts of this tutorial. The web UI is a fairly standard web client using Angular. 

For more details on using the Quix Streaming Reader API see the [API documentation](../../apis/streaming-reader-api/overview.md).

## üë©‚Äçüî¨ Lab - Explore the UI 

If you have not done so, explore the web UI. 

1. In your pipeline view, click on the `external link` icon:

    ![External link](./images/external-link.png)

2. Now interact with the web UI.

Have fun!
