# Welcome

<p style="font-size: 1rem;">Quix is a complete platform for developing, deploying, and monitoring stream processing pipelines. You can build producer/consumer/transform apps with Quix Streams and Python, build and test pipelines with the Quix CLI, and then deploy, manage and observe the pipelines in Quix Cloud.</p>

## Workflow summary

Your Quix workflow:

1. Develop your applications locally in Python with Quix Streams, the Quix CLI, and your IDE of choice.
2. Test and debug your pipeline locally with the Quix CLI and Docker.
3. Deploy to Quix Cloud for scalability and observability.
