<p style="font-size: 1rem;">Quix is a telemetry analytics platform that enables you to consolidate high frequency sensor data in a centralized cloud data store, for use cases like real-time monitoring and analytics, predictive maintenance, digital twins, and more. Quix provides the ability to connect, transform and process data in batch or real-time architectures and between legacy and modern systems in any language using easily customisable connectors.</p>
