# MQTT

[This code sample](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/sources/MQTT) demonstrates how to consume data from an MQTT broker and publish that data to a Kafka topic.

## How to run

Create a [Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.io/signup?xlink=github) account or log-in and visit the Samples to use this project.

Clicking `Deploy` on the Sample, deploys a pre-built container in Quix. Complete the environment variables to configure the container.

Clicking `Edit code` on the Sample, forks the project to your own Git repo so you can customize it before deploying.
