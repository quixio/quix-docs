## What data is <span id="techname">MySQL</span> good for?

<!--[tech-data-seo-text]-->
MySQL is highly effective for structured data where relationships between data entities exist, making it well-suited for transactional data, web applications, and business systems that require consistent, reliable, and multi-user access.

## What challenges do organizations have with <span id="techname">MySQL</span> and real-time data?

<!--[tech-challenges-seo-text]-->
Organizations often encounter challenges with MySQL when handling real-time data due to its inherent design as a traditional relational database, which might not be optimized for high-speed streaming and low-latency updates. While MySQL supports real-time data ingestion, scaling this process often requires additional infrastructure or architectural changes, like sharding, to efficiently manage incoming data loads.
